  This readme will attempt to break down my Xmonad config section by section. Please bare in mind that I have only been using Xmonad since mid March of this year and I do not know haskell but have been fairly successful in adding the necessary features to my setup to facilitate my workflow. Let's get it..

  Out of the scope of this readme, but I recommend you read on how to setup Xmonad has a stack/cabal project that way you can leverage nvim internal LSP with haskell language server to facilitate modification of the config file. Also Xmonad + Kmonad = game changer. I do not need to spend 300 on mechanical keyboard with layers.
